# ExamService

## Disclaimer

This project only serves the purpose to prepare me and other students of HTBLA Kaindorf for the upcoming "Schriftliche Reifepr√ºfung Fachklausur".
I am certainly aware that this code does not provide a reference for state-of-the-art Spring Security implementations and includes several
questionable design decisions!

## Description

This application manages several exams and their results. It loads the students (with their passwords) from a json file. 
Also, the exams (+ their results) can be found in a json file. They get loaded into the database (if you want to try it out you can just use the database configuration which can be found in the docker-compose). 
Also the app implement JWT authentication using Spring Security. 

## Endpoint Description

The application provides a REST-Api with several endpoints which are defined as follows:

`POST /public/sigin`

Expected Payload:
```json
{
    "username": "Anna Schmidt",
    "password": "Anna5184!"
